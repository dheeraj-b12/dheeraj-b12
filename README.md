# Hi, I'm Dheeraj 👋

I'm an IT engineer based in Bangalore.  

I design and build whatever I can imagine.  

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll build it and ship it.  

My main tech stack is React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Framer Motion.  

My favorite tools are Figma, Apple Notes, and Procreate on my iPad.  

I've got a bunch of pinned projects.  

I've built over 100 public repos — privately, probably more than 200.  


## Fun Facts

- I have one dog  
- I don't like coffee or tea  
- Solo Leveling is my favorite anime  
- Hobbies: anime, gym, building things
